        <h1>The Elements of the Zodiac Signs</h1>
        <div class="shield" id="description">
            <p>Each of the zodiac signs is ruled by an element: fire, earth, air, or water. Each of the elements is
                characterized by different strengths and tendencies. But how each star sign is affected by its element
                is
                unique to that sign.</p>
            <p>Water signs are seen as shy, reserved, and sensitive, but also intuitive and in-tune with their feelings.
                They make natural empaths, with an ability to tap into the emotions of people around them. They're
                nurturing
                towards the ones they love but need to be careful they're not overly giving with anyone who might take
                advantage of this quality. The water signs are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.</p>
            <p>Fire signs, meanwhile, are known for passion, creativity, competitiveness, and inspiration.</p>
            <p>Earth signs are considered conservative, realistic, and "down-to-earth." Patience is what gets them ahead
                in
                life, because they understand the importance of building up personal or professional goals over time.
                They
                love to be spoiled but do the same for anyone lucky enough to win their affections. The earth signs are
                Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.</p>
            <p>Finally, air signs are thought of as rational, social, and intellectual. People with this sign are
                naturally
                friendly, communicative, and analytical. Their curiosity makes them excellent students, and most
                continue to
                self-educate long after they've completed formal schooling. They love keeping up-to-date with their
                friends,
                but need to be mindful to carve out time for quiet reflection, and avoid overstimulation, anxiety, or
                insomnia. The air signs are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.</p>

        <h2>The Zodiac Signs Traits</h2>
        <div class="shield" id="description">
            <p id="1"><strong>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</strong></p>
            <div class="two_col">
                <p>Aries loves to be number one, so it’s no surprise that these audacious rams are the first sign of the
                    zodiac. Bold and ambitious, Aries dives headfirst into even the most challenging situations (which
                    is
                    appropriate, since the body part associated with Aries is the head). Like their fellow fire signs,
                    Leo
                    and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who builds community with
                    their
                    cheerful disposition and relentless determination. Uncomplicated and direct in their approach, they
                    often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances. They like things quick and
                    dirty, a
                    temperament also reflected in their sexual proclivities.</p>

            <p id="2"><strong>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</strong></p>
            <div class="two_col">
                <p>Taurus is an earth sign represented by the bull. Like their celestial spirit animal, Taureans enjoy
                    relaxing in serene, bucolic environments, surrounded by soft sounds, soothing aromas, and succulent
                    flavors. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the enchanting planet that governs love, beauty, and money.
                    Taurus’s
                    Venusian influence make this earth sign the most sensual of the zodiac: These cosmic oxen are
                    enchanted
                    by any physical manifestation of comfort and luxury. Pleasure is a necessity for epicurean Taureans
                    and
                    they feel most content when pampered. (Taurus governs the neck, so neck caresses are especially
                    irresistible to these bulls.)</p>

                <p>Have you ever been so busy that you wished you could clone yourself just to get everything done?
                    That’s
                    the Gemini experience in a nutshell. Appropriately symbolized by the celestial twins, this air sign
                    was
                    interested in so many pursuits that it had to double itself. Because of Geminis' intrinsic duality,
                    they're often falsely misrepresented as two-faced. In reality, however, Gemini rarely has a hidden
                    agenda. Playful and intellectually curious, Gemini is constantly juggling a variety of passions,
                    hobbies, careers, and friend groups. They are the social butterflies of the zodiac: These
                    quick-witted
                    twins can talk to anyone about anything. Find them buzzing between happy hours, dinner parties, and

                <p>Cancer is a cardinal water sign. Represented by the crab, this oceanic crustacean seamlessly weaves
                    between the sea and shore, representing Cancer’s ability to exist in both emotional and material
                    realms.
                    Cancers are highly intuitive and their psychic abilities manifest in tangible spaces: For instance,
                    Cancers can effortlessly pick up the energies in a room. These crabs are highly sensitive to their
                    environments, as well as extremely self-protective. Much like their celestial spirit animal, Cancers
                    are
                    shielded by hard, external shells. At first, these crabs may be perceived as cold or distant. With
                    time,
                    though, Cancers reveal their gentle nature, genuine compassion, and mystical capabilities. Just
                    don't be
                    surprised if it takes a while to get to know them.</p>

                    fire
                    signs are the kings and queens of the celestial jungle. They’re delighted to embrace their royal
                    status:
                    Vivacious, theatrical, and passionate, Leos love to bask in the spotlight and celebrate themselves.
                    These lions are natural leaders and they enjoy cultivating friendships and romances that are
                    artistically and creatively inspired. Playful Leos have no problem leaning into drama-fueled
                    romances
                    that are perfectly suited for the tabloids. (In fact, they may even prefer them.) After all, every
                    Leo
                    perceives him or herself as a celebrity. These astrological divas never get tired of lavish dinners,

                    association
                    that speaks to Virgo’s deep-rooted presence in the material world. Virgos are logical, practical,
                    and
                    systematic in their approach to life. This earth sign is a perfectionist at heart and isn’t afraid
                    to
                    improve skills through diligent and consistent practice. Virgo rules the digestive system, which
                    makes
                    these earth signs especially attuned to the ingredients that make up a whole — in food and in

                    zodiac),
                    an association that reflects Libra's fixation on balance and harmony. Libra is obsessed with
                    symmetry
                    and strives to create equilibrium in all areas of life. These air signs are the aesthetes of the
                    zodiac:
                    Ruled by Venus, the planet that governs love, beauty, and money, Libras adore high art,
                    intellectualism,
                    and connoisseurship. Suave Libras need to surround themselves with stunning objects and create

                <p>Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac. Because of its incredible passion and
                    power, Scorpio is often mistaken for a fire sign. In fact, Scorpio is a water sign that derives its
                    strength from the psychic, emotional realm. Like fellow water signs, Cancer and Pisces, Scorpio is
                    extremely clairvoyant and intuitive.What makes this water sign unique is its distinctive venomous
                    sting.
                    Like their celestial spirit animal, the scorpion, Scorpios lie in wait and strike when least
                    expected.
                    Life is a game of chess for these calculating water signs, who are constantly plotting several steps
                    ahead in order to orchestrate an eventual checkmate. This doesn't mean their intentions are
                    necessarily
                    nefarious. Scorpios simply know what they want and aren't afraid to work hard and play the long game

                    experience, I
                    can honestly say that there is no zodiac sign like Sagittarius. What makes Sagittarius so unique is
                    its

                    half-horse centaur), Sagittarius isn't afraid to use its bow and arrow to explore expansive terrain,
                    seeking answers in places and spaces others wouldn’t dare venture. Whether they're white water

                    I've worked with thousands of clients over my nearly-10 year-long career as a professional
                    astrologer,
                    and I can confirm that there's something that makes Capricorn extremely special. Perhaps it's their

                    face

                    rarely
                    depicted in standard personality assessments, but that rumbles within the soul of every Capricorn:
                    Not
                    everyone gets to see Capricorn ordering rounds of tequila, dancing on the table, and staying out
                    until
                    the crack of dawn — but that rebellious, untamed spirit is a Capricorn asset. I mean, how else do

                <p>As you can imagine, I encounter a lot of misconceptions as a professional astrologer — not just
                    regarding
                    my career as a stargazer, but also relating to the technical aspects of astrology. One of the most
                    ubiquitous, albeit innocuous, errors is that Aquarius is a water sign. I could certainly understand
                    the
                    confusion here — especially with "aqua" as the prefix — but once you get to know this zodiac sign,
                    it
                    becomes strikingly clear that Aquarius is an air sign. As the eleventh and penultimate sign of the
                    zodiac, Aquarius is actually the final air sign, which means it deals with air-related concepts
                    (we'll
                    get more into that momentarily) from a macro-perspective. Of all the zodiac signs, Aquarius is
                    undoubtedly the most innovative, progressive, rebellious, and humanitarian. And while Aquarius can
                    often
                    be found planning a revolution or proudly flaunting their funky fashion sensibility, they also have
                    an
                    often overlooked sensitive side that requires appreciation, support, and love.</p>

            <div class="two_col">
                <p>Pisces, a water sign, is the last constellation of the zodiac. It's symbolized by two fish swimming
                    in
                    opposite directions, representing the constant division of Pisces's attention between fantasy and
                    reality. As the final sign, Pisces has absorbed every lesson — the joys and the pains, the hopes and
                    the
                    fears — learned by all of the other signs. This makes these fish the most psychic, empathetic, and
                    compassionate creatures of the astrological wheel. With such immense sensitivity, Pisces can easily
                    become swallowed by emotions and must remember to stay grounded in the material realm
                    (appropriately,
                    Pisces rules the feet).</p>
